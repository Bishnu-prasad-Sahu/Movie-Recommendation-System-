## 📊 Dataset  

- **File:** `movies.csv`  
- Contains information about movies such as:  
  - Movie ID  
  - Title  
  - Genres  
- This dataset is used to build a recommendation engine that suggests movies to users.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Data handling)  
  - `scikit-learn` (ML models & similarity measures)  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Visualization)  

## 📌 Features  

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of movie dataset  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Content-based recommendation system using **cosine similarity**  
- Suggests top similar movies to a given movie  
- Visualizations of popular genres and movie trends
